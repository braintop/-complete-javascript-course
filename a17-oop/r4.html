// Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects
// inherit features from one another.
// we will explain how prototype chains
// work and look at how the prototype property
// can be used to add methods to existing constructors.

//Understanding prototype objects
//In this example, we have defined a constructor function, like so:
    function Person(first, last, age, gender, interests) {
        // property and method definitions
        this.name = {
        'first': first,
        'last' : last
        };
        this.age = age;
        this.gender = gender;
        //...
    }
let person1 = new Person('Bob', 'Smith', 32, 'male', ['music', 'skiing']);
//If you type "person1." into your JavaScript console,
// you should see the browser try to auto-complete this
// with the member names available on this object:
