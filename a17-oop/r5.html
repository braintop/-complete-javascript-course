            // This looks similar to the Person constructor in many ways,
            // but there is something strange here that we've
            // not seen before â€” the call() function.
            // This function basically allows you to call a function defined somewhere else,
            // but in the current context. The first parameter specifies the value of this that
            // you want to use when running the function, 
            // and the other parameters are those that should be passed to the
            // function when it is invoked.
            
            // We want the Teacher() constructor to take 
            // the same parameters as the Person() 
            // constructor it is inheriting from, 
            // so we specify them all as parameters
            // in the call() invocation.

            // The last line inside the constructor defines
            // the new subject property that teachers are 
            // going to have, which generic people don't have.
            // As a note, we could have done this:
