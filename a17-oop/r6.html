            // Inheriting from a constructor with no parameters
            // Note that if the constructor you are inheriting from
            // doesn't take its property values from parameters,
            // you don't need to specify them as additional arguments in call().
            // So, for example, if you had something really simple like this:
            function Brick() {
            this.width = 10;
            this.height = 20;
            }
            //You could inherit the width and height properties
            //by doing this (as well as the other steps described below,
            // of course):
            function BlueGlassBrick() {
                Brick.call(this);
                this.opacity = 0.5;
                this.color = 'blue';
            }
            //good to konw 
            //Note that we've only specified this inside call() — no other
            //parameters are required as we are not inheriting
            //any properties
            //from the parent that are set via parameters.

            //Setting Teacher()'s prototype and constructor reference
            // All is good so far, but we have a problem.
            // We have defined a new constructor, 
            // and it has a prototype property, 
            // which by default just contains an object with 
            // a reference to the constructor function itself.
            // It does not contain the methods of the Person constructor's
            // prototype property. To see this,
            // enter Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Teacher.prototype)
            // into either the text input field or your JavaScript console.
            // Then enter it again, replacing Teacher with Person. 
            // Nor does the new constructor inherit those methods. To see this, compare the outputs of
            // Person.prototype.greeting and Teacher.prototype.greeting.
            // We need to get Teacher() to inherit the methods defined on Person()'s prototype.
            // So how do we do that?

            //Add the following line below your previous addition
            Teacher.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
            Object.defineProperty(Teacher.prototype, 'constructor', {
            value: Teacher,
            enumerable: false, // so that it does not appear in 'for in' loop
            writable: true });

            //Giving Teacher() a new greeting() function
            // To finish off our code, we need to define a new greeting() function on the Teacher() constructor.
            // The easiest way to do this is to define it on Teacher()'s prototype — add the following at the bottom of your code:
            Teacher.prototype.greeting = function() {
            let prefix;

            if (this.gender === 'male' || this.gender === 'Male' || this.gender === 'm' || this.gender === 'M') {
                prefix = 'Mr.';
            } else if (this.gender === 'female' || this.gender === 'Female' || this.gender === 'f' || this.gender === 'F') {
                prefix = 'Ms.';
            } else {
                prefix = 'Mx.';
            }
            alert('Hello. My name is ' + prefix + ' ' + this.name.last + ', and I teach ' + this.subject + '.');
            };
