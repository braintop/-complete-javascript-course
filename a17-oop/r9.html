//             Getters and Setters
// There may be times when we want to change the values of properties in the classes we create,
// or times when we don't know what the final value of a particular property will be.
// Using the Teacher example, we may not know what subject the teacher will teach
// before we create them, or their subject may change between terms.

// We can handle such situations with getters and setters.

// Let's enhance the Teacher class with getters and setters.
// The class starts the same as it was the last time we looked at it.

// Getters and setters work in pairs. 
// A getter returns the current value of the variable and its corresponding
// setter changes the value of the variable to the one it defines.

        class Teacher extends Person {
        constructor(first, last, age, gender, interests, subject, grade) {
            super(first, last, age, gender, interests);
            // subject and grade are specific to Teacher
            this._subject = subject;
            this.grade = grade;
        }
        get subject() {
            return this._subject;
        }
        set subject(newSubject) {
            this._subject = newSubject;
        }
        }
// To show the current value of the _subject property of the snape object
// we can use the snape.subject getter method.
// To assign a new value to the _subject property we can use the
// snape.subject="new value" setter method.
// The example below shows the two features in action:

// Check the default value
console.log(snape.subject) // Returns "Dark arts"

// Change the value
snape.subject = "Balloon animals" // Sets _subject to "Balloon animals"

// Check it again and see if it matches the new value
console.log(snape.subject) // Returns "Balloon animals"
