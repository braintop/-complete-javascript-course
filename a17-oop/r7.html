            // ECMAScript 2015 Classes
            // ECMAScript 2015 introduces class syntax to JavaScript
            // as a way to write reusable classes using easier,
            // cleaner syntax, which is more similar to classes in C++ or Java.
            // In this section we'll convert the Person and Teacher examples from 
            // prototypal inheritance to classes, to show you how it's done.
            
            //Let's look at a rewritten version of the Person example, class-style:
            class Person {
            constructor(first, last, age, gender, interests) {
                this.name = {
                first,
                last
                };
                this.age = age;
                this.gender = gender;
                this.interests = interests;
            }

            greeting() {
                console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name.first}`);
            };

            farewell() {
                console.log(`${this.name.first} has left the building. Bye for now!`);
            };
            }
            // The class statement indicates that we are creating a new class. Inside this block, we define all the features of the class:
            // The constructor() method defines the constructor function that represents our Person class.
            // greeting() and farewell() are class methods. Any methods you want associated with the class are defined inside it, after the constructor. In this example, 
            // we've used template literals rather than string concatenation to make the code easier to read.
            // We can now instantiate object instances using the new operator, in just the same way as we did before:
            let han = new Person('Han', 'Solo', 25, 'male', ['Smuggling']);
            han.greeting();
            // Hi! I'm Han

            let leia = new Person('Leia', 'Organa', 19, 'female', ['Government']);
            leia.farewell();
            // Leia has left the building. Bye for now
            
            // Inheritance with class syntax
            // Above we created a class to represent a person.
            // They have a series of properties that are common to all people;
            // in this section we'll create our specialized Teacher class, 
            // making it inherit from Person using modern class syntax. 
            // This is called creating a subclass or subclassing.
            // To create a subclass we use the extends keyword to
            // tell JavaScript the class we want to base our class on,
            class Teacher extends Person {
            constructor(subject, grade) {
                super(); // Now 'this' is initialized by calling the parent constructor.
                this.subject = subject;
                this.grade = grade;
                }
            }
