1. Create one worker array for each shift

 the others are simple workers.
 For Mike (shift 1) create one variable ('SM')
 with the worker's name, and one array
 ('simpleWorkers') with all the remaining  field workers
3. Create an array 'allWorkers' containing all workers of both shifts (12 workers)
4. Write a function ('tipped') that receives an arbitrary number of worker names 
(NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console,
