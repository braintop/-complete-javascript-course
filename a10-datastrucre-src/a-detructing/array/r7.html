            //Parsing an array returned from a function
            //It's always been possible to return an array from a function. Destructuring can make working with an array return value more concise.
            //In this example, f() returns the values [1, 2] as its output, which can be parsed in a single line with destructuring.
            function f() {
                return [1, 2];
            }
            let a, b;
            [a, b] = f();
            console.log(a); // 1
            console.log(b); // 2
